        <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog 1: Random Room of Shit</h3>
        <p>The first real romhack I made of StH, and probably the last. A few other hacks were made before, but they were really only palette swaps for Sonic.</p>
        <p>This hack includes palette swaps, and 2 (mostly) complete zones, namely Green Hill and Marble.</p>
        <h4>Green Hill</h4>
        <p>It's honestly not my worst work. It was difficult working with Sonic 1's 256&Cross;256 - based tiles, but the end result could have been way worse.</p>
        <p>The boss arena needs a lot of work, however.</p>
        <h4>Marble</h4>
        <p>The level design here is definetely a weak point.</p>
        <p>The difficulty working with 256&Cross;256 - based tiles really proved to be a key factor in this. While not by much, I do believe that the level design could have been improved if a 16&Cross;16 - based tile system was used instead.</p>
        <p>That, however, would not fix the amount of blind falls and general dick moves that are in this zone.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Supersonic Mario Bros.</h3>
        <p>My first and only hack of Super Mario Bros.</p>
        <p>The general idea was to loosely recreate the levels of Sonic the Hedgehog within it.</p>
        <p>Obviously, some liberties had to be taken, as SMB1 has more limitations than what meets the eye.</p>
        <p>The hack lasts until Zone 4-2.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Supersonic Mario Bros. 4: Supersonic Mario World</h3>
        <p>The same idea as Supersonic Mario Bros, but in Super Mario World instead.</p>
        <p>Also my first Super Mario World romhack.</p>
        <p>Includes SMB's World 1-1 as the title screen level, and is selectable from the world map.</p>
        <p>Hack only lasts until Zone 1-3.</p>
